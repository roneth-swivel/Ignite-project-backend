- Validation for request payloads.
- Swagger-based API documentation.
- Built-in support for switching between development and production environments.
- Extensible and easy-to-use structure.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Framework for React with server-side rendering support.
- **Swagger**: API documentation and testing.
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **Express-like API Routes**: Provided by Next.js.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/employee-management-api.git
   cd employee-management-api
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

---

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

To start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

- API endpoints will be available at `http://localhost:3000/api`.
- Swagger documentation will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/swagger`.

### Production Mode

To build and run in production:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

- API endpoints and Swagger documentation will still be accessible, but optimized for production.

## API Documentation

Swagger is used for API documentation. Access it at `/swagger` after starting the server.

### Example Endpoints:

1. **Get All Employees**
   - **GET** `/api/employee`
   - Response:  
     ```json
     [
       {
         "id": 1,
         "name": "John Doe",
         "email": "john@example.com"
       }
     ]
     ```

2. **Add a New Employee**
   - **POST** `/api/employee`
   - Request Body:  
     ```json
     {
       "name": "Jane Smith",
       "email": "jane@example.com"
     }
     ```

3. **Update an Employee**
   - **PUT** `/api/employee/:empId`
   - Request Body:  
     ```json
     {
       "name": "John Updated",
       "email": "johnupdated@example.com"
     }
     ```

   npm install --save-dev jest supertest
   ```

2. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Future Improvements

- Add database connectivity (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL).
- Extend validation rules for input fields.
- Implement authentication for secure access.
